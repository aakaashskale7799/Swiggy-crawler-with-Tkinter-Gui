# Swiggy-crawler-with-Tkinter-Gui
Let's crawl data from swiggy.com of all the cities with links. And the restaurants available in that city with links and save in "csv" format separately. 
Here I have wrote simple code to crawl city name, links and the restaurants present in the particular city
The data crawled is saved seprately.

How to use it:

1.
You can see in the gui (Gui.png) second line says 
"Enter swiggy link to download all city links" here you are suppose to input "https://www.swiggy.com" 
to save all city names and their respective links as "city links.csv",
then click on button next to text box,  label "get all city of india"
and voila you have all the city name and their respective links saved in csv format.

2.
You can see in the gui (Gui.png) first line says
"Enter city link to get all restraurant links" here you are suppose to input "https://www.swiggy.com/" + city name
for example "https://www.swiggy.com/mumbai" or "https://www.swiggy.com/pune" 
you can get this links and name of all restraurant from page one to last page (Pagination)
then click on button next to text box,  label "get restraurant link of particular city"
and voila you have the names of all restraurants and their respective links saved in csv format.

3.
To end the program click on "Quit" button

Future scope: 
1.To apply proxies so that there wont be any disturbance while crawling
2.Integrate zomato crawler
3.After integrating comapring the food rates and recommend the best one.
